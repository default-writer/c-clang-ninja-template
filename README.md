# C++ Makefile Template

A simple and modern C++ project template using Make, Clang, and Visual Studio Code.

This template provides a ready-to-use development environment for C++ projects on Debian-based Linux systems (including WSL), with a focus on modern tooling.
## Credits

*   This project template and its documentation were created with the help of [Gemini Code Assist](https://gemini.google.com/app).
*   The core compiler toolchain is provided by the [GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [NMAKE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/nmake-reference?view=msvc-170).
*   The Linux environment is based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [CLANG](https://clang.llvm.org/), [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), [LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org) and [LLVM Project](https://apt.llvm.org/).
*   The Windows environment is based on [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/), [Clang/LLVM support in Visual Studio projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-msbuild?view=msvc-170) and [Visual Studio 2022 Community Toolkit](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

## Features

*   **Build System**: A straightforward `Makefile` for compiling your project.
*   **Compiler**: Configured to use the **Clang** C++ compiler.
*   **Toolchain**: Automated installation of the complete LLVM/Clang toolchain (version 21), including:
    *   `clangd` for language server support (autocompletion, diagnostics).
    *   `lldb` and `lldb-dap` for powerful debugging.
    *   `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` for code formatting and static analysis.
*   **VS Code Integration**:
    *   Recommended extensions for a seamless C++ development experience.
    *   Pre-configured `build` task.
    *   Pre-configured `debug` launch configuration.

## Environment Setup

*   **On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**

    An installation script is provided to set up the complete LLVM/Clang development environment. To run it, execute the following command from the project root:

    ```bash
    ./bin/install.sh
    ```

    The script uses `sudo` for system-wide package installation, so it will likely prompt you for your password.

*   **On Windows**

    On Windows, you need the C++ build tools, which are part of Visual Studio. You can install **Visual Studio 2022 Community** with the required "Desktop development with C++" workload and the **C++ Clang Compiler for Windows** by running the following command in an administrator terminal:

    ```bash
    winget install "Visual Studio Community 2022" --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Llvm.Clang" -s msstore
    ```

## Usage in VS Code

1.  **Open the folder in VS Code.**
2.  When prompted, **install the recommended extensions**. These are crucial for language support (`vscode-clangd`) and debugging (`lldb-dap`).
3.  **Build the project**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (or `Cmd+Shift+B` on macOS) to run the default build task, which executes `make`.
4.  **Debug the application**:
    *   Set a breakpoint in `main.cpp`.
    *   Go to the "Run and Debug" view (the bug icon in the activity bar) and press the green play button (or simply press `F5`).

## History

*  20-09-2025: Added cross-platform build support in VS Code for Windows (`nmake`), Linux, and macOS (`make`).
*  21-09-2025: Initial project setup with C/C++ source, Linux Makefile, and VS Code configuration.
